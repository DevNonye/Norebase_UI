                    100,000 KShs. divided into 1,000 ordinary shares of 100

                    A local address is a requirement for all companies. If you
                    do not have one, we can provide you with a local address for
                    an annual fee of $600. This service will be discontinued if
                    the fee is not renewed at the end of each 1 year period.

                  <p>
                    At least 1 director is required at incorporation. A local
                    participant with a KRA PIN (either a citizen or a
                    non-citizen with a residency permit), acting as a director,
                    a shareholder or the company secretary, is also required.
                    You are required to input the local participantâ€™s KRA PIN in
                    the required field during the application. If your company
                    does not have such a local representative/participant, you
                    can elect to have Norebase act as company Secretary through
                    our partner(s). for an annual fee. This elected actor can be
                    replaced once a resident participant is available.
